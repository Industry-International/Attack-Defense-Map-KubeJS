     * Represents the basic unit at the heart of the permission system.
     * 
     * A permission indicates the ability for an actor to perform an action,
     * in its most general sense. In the permission system, all permissions are encoded as instances of this class,
     * optionally integrated by a `PermissionDynamicContext`.
     * 
     * A node is uniquely identified by its `nodeName`,
     * which is a dot-separated string providing meaning to the node itself.
     * The suggested structure of the name is `modid.name`, where `modid` is the ID of the owner of the node.
     * This API **does not require** any implicit hierarchy,
     * so `modid.name` is not considered a parent of `modid.name.sub`. Such decisions are left to the `IPermissionHandler`.
     * 
     * Each node also has an associated `PermissionType`, detailing its exact type,
     * along with a `PermissionResolver` that is used to obtain the default value of the permission.
     * More information can be found on their documentation.
     * 
     * A node can also be bound to additional `PermissionDynamicContextKey`s,
     * which are used when querying the availability of the permission.
     * There are no restrictions on their amount. It is also not mandatory to provide a value for all dynamics in a permission query.
     * See the above link for more information.
     * 
     * Each node should be registered via the `Nodes` and stored statically in a field.
     * That instance should then be reused every-time a permission check needs to be performed via `PermissionAPI#getPermission(ServerPlayer, PermissionNode, PermissionDynamicContext[])`.
