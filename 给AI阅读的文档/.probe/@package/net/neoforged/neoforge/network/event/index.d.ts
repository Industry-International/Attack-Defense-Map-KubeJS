     * Payloads should not write their ids within their `StreamCodec`, as this will be done automatically.

     * Payloads may only be sent over the `ConnectionProtocol` they were registered for.
     * By default, `PayloadRegistrar` will wrap handlers so they execute on the main thread instead of the network thread.
     * Payloads are always serialized, including for memory connections (singleplayer and LAN hosts).
